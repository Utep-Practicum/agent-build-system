### Construct Dependencies From Relationships

  - Provides a graphical means to confirm relationships as dependencies

  - A dependency is defined as a user-verified relationship that must be executed and fed to the runner component.

  - A relationship's artifacts can be edited, deleted, and ignored as desired.

  - Each artifact contains a delta time attribute to indicate the time taken before the next artifact was captured.

  - Find, Undo, and Save Capabilites are provided for all builder projects.
